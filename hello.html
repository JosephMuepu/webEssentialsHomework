    <h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>
    <br/>
    <h3>A little about me:</h3>
    <div>
      <p>My name as you may have already guessed is Christopher. I currently work as a field service technician for Willscot Detroit, but I have 10 years of experience as a Low Voltage Communications technician. 
         I have recently found a passion in technology. I recently built my first computer, on which I enjoy playing video games. I have decided I want to make a career change. So, I am currently teaching myself coding, 
         specifically Python and Django as well as some JavaScript, and now this Web Essentials in HTML and CSS. My goal is to someday start my own web developement agency, to offer clients a wide array of web services: 
         from simple landing pages to complicated e-commerce functionality, along with the future possibilty of mobile app developement as well.
      </p>

      <p>I am a father to two wonderful children, Alexander and Lorelai. My wife, Anna, and I are expecting our third child, Henrik in June. Together we have two dogs, Mallory and Koda. We also have two cats, Kitten Mittens, and Shadow. 
      My wife and I also practice photography and plan to start our own business soon. As a family we thouroughly enjoy the outdoors from camping and hiking, to kayaking and skiing. I want to change careers so that I can have more freedom of time 
      to enjoy my family and to better provide for them. We are also a bunch of nerds. We enjoy video games, board games, and even play Dungeons and Dragons together as a family.
